This project consist on implementing a compiler for a fragment of C (called Mini C). The project is detailed in [this website](https://www.enseignement.polytechnique.fr/informatique/INF564/projet/sujet-v1.pdf)

The directory has the following structure:

.\
├── Compiler.pdf\
├── README.md\
├── mini-c ── ..\
└── tests ── ..

Compiler.pdf is the report we wrote.
mini-c is the directory containing the source code.
tests is the directory containing the tests provided by the teacher, and 6 other tests added by ourselves.
